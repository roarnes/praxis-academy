James Carroll Booker III (December 17, 1939 â€“ November 8, 1983) was a New Orleans rhythm and blues keyboardist born in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Booker's unique style combined rhythm and blues with jazz standards. Musician Dr. John described Booker as "the best black, gay, one-eyed junkie piano genius New Orleans has ever produced."[2] Flamboyant in personality, he was known as "the Black Liberace"
